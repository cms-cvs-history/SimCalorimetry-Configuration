   # This is the sequence that runs unsuppressed Ecal digis 
   # + zero-suppression in the Ecal+PreShower
   #
   # Note : this cff includes setup for both Ecal&Hcal geom.services
   #        (Geometry/CaloEventSetup/data/CaloGeometry.cfi) that
   #        are *both* needed, even if only one digitizer is to run
